1:52 scale conversions

Scale factor:

1 / 52 ≈ 0.01923


## A. 6 ft × 26 in sheet

Real size (cm):

6 ft = 72 in → 182.9 cm

26 in → 66.0 cm

At 1:52:

Length: 182.9 × 1/52 ≈ 3.5 cm

Width: 66.0 × 1/52 ≈ 1.27 cm

👉 Use ~3.5 × 1.3 cm for a “short” panel.


## B. 8 ft × 26 in sheet

Real size:

8 ft = 96 in → 243.8 cm

26 in → 66.0 cm

At 1:52:

Length: 243.8 × 1/52 ≈ 4.7 cm

Width: ≈ 1.27 cm

👉 Use ~4.7 × 1.3 cm for longer trench panels or overhead covers.


## C. 10 ft × 2 ft sheet (Nissen-type, for huts or roofs)

Real size:

10 ft = 304.8 cm

2 ft = 61.0 cm

At 1:52:

Length: 304.8 × 1/52 ≈ 5.9 cm

Width: 61.0 × 1/52 ≈ 1.17 cm

👉 Use ~5.9 × 1.2 cm when copying Nissen-hut style panels.


## Corrugation spacing in scale

Classic 3" corrugation pitch:

Real: 7.6 cm between wave peaks

At 1:52: 7.6 × 1/52 ≈ 0.15 cm ≈ 1.5 mm

👉 For 1:52 terrain, corrugated plastic/styrene with about 1.3–1.6 mm wave
spacing looks bang on for WW1 sheeting.


## TL;DR for your terrain

For French (or British/German) WW1 trenches at 1:52 heroic:

Cut panels roughly 3.5 × 1.3 cm (6 ft sheets)

Mix in some 4.7 × 1.3 cm (8 ft sheets) for variety

Use corrugated material with about 1.5 mm pitch

That’ll look very authentic when set between timber posts with sandbags on top.
