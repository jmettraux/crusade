# paper + plaster + PVA

Here’s a solid, field-tested paper + plaster + PVA “Sculptamold-style” recipe
that hobbyists and wargame-terrain builders use when commercial Sculptamold
isn’t available:

## Homemade Sculptamold Recipe

Ingredients (by volume)

* Plaster of Paris (石膏 / sekkō)	2 parts	any art- or modeling-grade plaster (e.g. Yoshino 模型用石膏)

* Torn paper pulp	1 part	soak shredded tissue, newsprint, or draft paper ≈ 1 h, then squeeze out excess water

* PVA glue (白ボンド)	½ part	gives strength and flexibility

* Water	adjust to taste (≈ 1 part)**	add gradually for a thick-oatmeal consistency

* add a spoon of acrylic paint or pigment to pre-tint the mix (optional)


## Mixing Steps

Make pulp – soak paper, tear by hand or blend; squeeze until damp but not
dripping.

Combine plaster + dry pulp in a bowl.

Add PVA and a little water, mixing until it’s like thick oatmeal that holds
peaks but spreads easily.

Apply over foam, cardboard, or wood base with a spatula or gloved hands.

Texture (rocks, soil, tool marks) while still wet.

Dry 12–24 h; hard in a few hours, fully cured overnight.


## Finish & Paint

Seal with diluted PVA or Mod Podge before painting.

Accepts acrylics and washes beautifully.

Sand lightly if needed once dry.


## Summary

2 parts plaster : 1 part paper : ½ part PVA (+ water) → a durable,
easy-textured terrain compound that behaves almost exactly like Sculptamold.

Would you like a metric version (in grams or millilitres) for precise
small-batch mixing?
