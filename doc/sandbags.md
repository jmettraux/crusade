# sandbags

In 32mm/heroic scale, commercial sandbags are often sculpted slightly oversized for visual readability.

So you have two options:

## A — True-scale (historically accurate)

* 10 mm long
* 5 mm wide
* 4 mm high

## B — Hobby-friendly (slightly heroic)

* 12–14 mm long
* 6–7 mm wide
* 4–5 mm high
