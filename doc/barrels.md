There aren’t precise published measured dimensions specifically for a World War I (1914) petrol barrel, but we do know the relevant historical standards that let us estimate it fairly well:

## Standard “barrel” size in the petroleum industry

A petroleum “barrel” was already standardized as 42 U.S. gallons by the late 1800s and still used in 1914 as both a unit of measure and typical barrel size for crude and refined products.

## Estimated physical dimensions

Historical wooden or early steel oil barrels holding ~42 US gal (≈ 159 L) had approximate dimensions like:

Height: ~ 35–38 inches (≈ 89–97 cm)

Diameter (widest point): ~ 22–24 inches (≈ 56–61 cm)

## Convert to 1:56 scale

Height

90 cm / 56 = 1.61 cm

97 cm / 56 = 1.73 cm

➡️ scaled height range ≈ 1.6–1.7 cm

Diameter

56 cm / 56 = 1.00 cm

61 cm / 56 = 1.09 cm

➡️ scaled diameter range ≈ 1.0–1.1 cm

## Recommended final dimensions for tabletop sculpt/print

To look right visually and account for heroic exaggeration:

| parameter | strict scale | suggested heroic sculpt |
| ---       | ---          | ---                     |
| height    | 1.6–1.7 cm   | 1.8 cm                  |
| diameter  | 1.0–1.1 cm   | 1.15 cm                 |
